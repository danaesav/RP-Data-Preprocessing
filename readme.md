# Evaluating the Scalability of Graph Neural Networks in Traffic Forecasting

This repository contains the preprocessing code for my bachelor thesis "Evaluating the Scalability of Graph Neural Networks in Traffic Forecasting" at TU Delft, 2024.

## Data
The data used in this project is the METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets, which can be downloaded from [this link]().
The .h5 files should be placed in the `Datasets/{dataset_name}` directory.

## Sensors
The sensor ids and their indices used in the experiment for each subset can be found in the `ids` and `indixes` directories respectively.
Visualizations of the sensors can be found in the `images` and `html` directories.

## Running
